<h2>Some Recent Ones I Saw In Theaters...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Keeper</h3>
<p>The projector broke and we were all refunded. I don't think
   this one would have been worth seeing anyway.
</p>
<h3>Marty Supreme</h3>
<p>I enjoyed this one! Timothée Chalamet played a colossal jerk!</p>
<h3>Primate</h3>
<p>I was expecting a horror-comedy, but this one really kept us
   on the edge of our seats!
